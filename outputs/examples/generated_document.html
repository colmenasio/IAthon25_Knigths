<li><strong>Extra_Tutorials</strong>: Participation in extra tutorials (Yes/No).</li>
<li><strong>Access_To_Learning_Materials</strong>: Access to essential learning materials (Yes/No).</li>
<li><strong>Parent_Involvement</strong>: Level of parental involvement (Low, Medium, High).</li>
<li><strong>IT_Knowledge</strong>: Student's level of IT knowledge (Low, Medium, High).</li>
<li><strong>Student_ID</strong>: A unique identifier for each student.</li>
<li><strong>Age</strong>: Age of the student in years.</li>
<li><strong>Gender</strong>: Gender of the student (Male, Female).</li>
<li><strong>Socioeconomic_Status</strong>: Socioeconomic status of the household (Low, Medium, High).</li>
<li><strong>Parent_Education_Level</strong>: Highest education level achieved by the parents (None, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary).</li>
<li><strong>Assignments_Completed</strong>: Number of assignments completed by the student.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Data Inspection</strong>:</li>
<li>The first few rows of the dataframe were displayed to understand its structure and the data it contains.</li>
<li>A summary of the dataframe was generated to check data types and identify any missing values.</li>
<li>
<p>Basic statistics of numerical columns were computed to gain insights into the data distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>The analysis focused on testing the statistical significance of gender and school type on JAMB scores.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Gender and JAMB Score Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>A t-test was conducted to analyze the relationship between <strong>Gender</strong> and <strong>JAMB_Score</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>python
  male_scores = df[df['Gender'] == 'Male']['JAMB_Score']
  female_scores = df[df['Gender'] == 'Female']['JAMB_Score']
  t_stat_gender, p_value_gender = stats.ttest_ind(male_scores, female_scores)</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Results</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>T-statistic</strong>: <code>t_stat_gender</code></li>
<li><strong>P-value</strong>: <code>p_value_gender</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the t-test indicate whether there is a significant difference between the JAMB scores of male and female students.</p>
<h3>School Type and JAMB Score Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>An ANOVA test was performed to analyze the effect of <strong>School_Type</strong> on <strong>JAMB_Score</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>python
  public_scores = df[df['School_Type'] == 'Public']['JAMB_Score']
  private_scores = df[df['School_Type'] == 'Private']['JAMB_Score']
  f_stat_school_type, p_value_school_type = stats.f_oneway(public_scores, private_scores)</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Results</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>F-statistic</strong>: <code>f_stat_school_type</code></li>
<li><strong>P-value</strong>: <code>p_value_school_type</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The results from the ANOVA test provide insights on whether the type of school (Public vs. Private) has a statistically significant effect on JAMB scores.</p>
<h3>Correlation Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>The correlation between <strong>Study_Hours_Per_Week</strong> and <strong>JAMB_Score</strong> was examined:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>python
  correlation_study_hours = df['Study_Hours_Per_Week'].corr(df['JAMB_Score'])</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Results</strong>:</li>
<li>The correlation value indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between study hours and JAMB scores.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Group Means Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>The impact of other categorical variables (like <strong>Extra_Tutorials</strong>, <strong>Access_To_Learning_Materials</strong>, <strong>Parent_Involvement</strong>, and <strong>IT_Knowledge</strong>) on JAMB scores was evaluated using group means:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>python
  group_means = df.groupby(['Extra_Tutorials', 'Access_To_Learning_Materials', 'Parent_Involvement', 'IT_Knowledge'])['JAMB_Score'].mean()</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Results</strong>:</li>
<li>The group means provide insights into how these categorical variables affect JAMB scores.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The analysis focused on assessing the impact of gender and school type on JAMB scores through statistical tests, as well as exploring correlations and group means based on other educational factors. The results will offer valuable insights into the factors influencing students' performance on the JAMB exam, which can be used for further research or educational policy formulation.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Further exploration of additional variables could be conducted to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing JAMB scores.</li>
<li>Visualization tools could enhance the interpretability of the results, assuming the necessary libraries are available.</li>
</ul>
