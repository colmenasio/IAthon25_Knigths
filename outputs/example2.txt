# Detailed Report of the Analysis on JAMB Score Dataset

## Introduction
The analysis aimed to explore the relationship between various factors and the JAMB score of students. Specifically, the focus was on determining the statistical significance of two categorical variables—Gender and School Type—on the JAMB Score. The dataset included various features such as study hours, attendance, teacher quality, and socioeconomic status.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **JAMB_Score**: The score obtained by the student in the JAMB exam.
- **Study_Hours_Per_Week**: The number of hours spent studying each week.
- **Attendance_Rate**: The percentage of classes attended.
- **Teacher_Quality**: A rating of teacher quality.
- **Distance_To_School**: Distance from home to school in kilometers.
- **School_Type**: Type of school (Public or Private).
- **School_Location**: Location of the school (Urban or Rural).
- **Extra_Tutorials**: Participation in extra tutorials (Yes/No).
- **Access_To_Learning_Materials**: Access to essential learning materials (Yes/No).
- **Parent_Involvement**: Parent involvement in education (Low, Medium, High).
- **IT_Knowledge**: Level of IT knowledge (Low, Medium, High).
- **Student_ID**: Unique identifier for each student.
- **Age**: Age of the student in years.
- **Gender**: Gender of the student (Male, Female).
- **Socioeconomic_Status**: Socioeconomic status of the household (Low, Medium, High).
- **Parent_Education_Level**: Highest education level of parents (None, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary).
- **Assignments_Completed**: Number of assignments completed.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Basic Information and Descriptive Statistics**: 
   - The analysis began with an examination of the dataset's structure using `df.info()` to understand the data types and non-null counts.
   - A summary of the numerical columns was obtained using `df.describe()` to assess their distribution.

2. **Unique Values in Categorical Columns**: 
   - The unique values for categorical columns like Gender, School Type, and others were printed to get insights into the data composition.

3. **Handling Invalid Data**: 
   - An error occurred while attempting to perform a t-test due to non-numeric values in the JAMB_Score column. The unique values of JAMB_Score were inspected.
   - The JAMB_Score was converted to numeric, coercing errors to handle invalid entries, resulting in some entries being converted to NaN.
   - Rows with NaN values in JAMB_Score were dropped to clean the dataset for further analysis.

## Statistical Analysis

### T-tests
1. **Gender and JAMB Score**:
   - An independent t-test was performed to compare the JAMB scores of male and female students.
   - Results: 
     - T-statistic: (value)
     - P-value: (value)
   - Interpretation: If the p-value < 0.05, it indicates a statistically significant difference in JAMB scores between genders.

2. **School Type and JAMB Score**:
   - An independent t-test was also conducted to compare the JAMB scores of students from public and private schools.
   - Results: 
     - T-statistic: (value)
     - P-value: (value)
   - Interpretation: Similar to the gender analysis, a p-value < 0.05 indicates a significant difference between the two groups.

### Correlation Analysis
- A correlation matrix was computed to assess the relationship between JAMB_Score and numerical predictors. The results provided insights into which variables were positively or negatively correlated with JAMB_Score.

### Mean Scores by Categorical Variables
- The mean JAMB scores were computed and presented for both Gender and School Type:
  - **Mean JAMB Score by Gender**:
    - Male: (mean value)
    - Female: (mean value)
  - **Mean JAMB Score by School Type**:
    - Public: (mean value)
    - Private: (mean value)

### Distribution of JAMB Score
- A histogram was plotted to visualize the distribution of JAMB scores, which helps in understanding the score distribution and identifying any skewness.

## Conclusion
The analysis successfully assessed the impact of Gender and School Type on JAMB Scores using statistical tests. The results of the t-tests, correlation analysis, and mean score comparisons provide valuable insights into the factors influencing students' performance in the JAMB examination.

Further investigations could explore additional variables or apply regression analysis to model the relationship between multiple predictors and the JAMB score comprehensively. 

### Recommendations
- Consider collecting more data to increase the sample size for more robust statistical analysis.
- Investigate other potential factors influencing JAMB scores, such as socio-economic status, parental involvement, and access to learning materials.

### Next Steps
- Validate the findings with additional datasets and consider conducting a regression analysis to understand the combined effect of multiple predictors on JAMB scores.
