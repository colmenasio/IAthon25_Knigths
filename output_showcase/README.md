# Result showcase

In this directory we share results of using Summarium on an arbitrary data set provided during the duration of the Event.

In this dataset data about train wheels wearing was provided and Summarium was tasked with statistically determining which fabrication parameters should be tweaked to achieve minimun wear

## The files
- `prompts.txt` contain the prompts used by the used. These and the csv dataset were the only human input provided to Summarium
- `report.html` and `report.pdf` contain the counseling results and suggested course of action autonmatically generated by Summarium
- `thinking_process.txt` contains a little sneak peek at the inner retroactive analisys motor by showing the scripts dynamically generated by a LLM and the iterative analysis cycle


Aditionally other unrelated similar examples on a different dataset and prompts are located in the subdirectory `other_examples`
